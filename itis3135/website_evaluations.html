			<h3 class=title><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2019/12/specials/year-in-pictures/">2019: The Year In Pictures</a> </h3>
			<p>
				Summarizing the news, entertainment, and sports that characterized 2019 through photos, 
				the “2019: The Year In Pictures” website by CNN won the 2020 Webby Award for the best use of photography, 
				granted to websites that rely on photographic imagery to enhance user experience. (Source:<a href="https://websitesetup.org/blog/best-designed-websites/"> WebsiteSetup</a>)
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><span style="color:PaleGoldenRod">Contrast</span> : even though this website has a lot of photos the text is easily readable due to 
					appropriate color contrast. Because of the dark background, the bright text color used stands out and is easy to read. <br></li>
				<li><span style="color:PaleGoldenRod">Repetition</span> : repetition in visual elements of design is strongly present. 
					Colors, fonts and shapes are used consistently and match between all pages of the website. <br></li>
				<li><span style="color:PaleGoldenRod">Alignment</span> : all elements line up and are presented in a very organized manner. 
					Every element has appropriate visual connection with other elements. <br></li>
				<li><span style="color:PaleGoldenRod">Proximity</span> : related elements are close together. For example the caption/description of every photo is placed consistently
					under each photo. The links to other pages of the website are grouped together at the beginning of the page. <br></li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class=title><a href="https://arngren.net/">Arngren Electronics</a> </h3>
			<p> 
				Arngren Electronics is a company that sells electronics , gadgets and hobby items by mail order.
				The company was started in 1983 by Frithjof Arngren.
				In 1994, they started mail order sales, and were a pioneer in the field. 
				The company had over 130,000 names in the customer database.
				In January 2000, the company was sold to investor and entrepreneur Simon Yuen who turned the mail order sale into an online store . 
				The company was declared bankrupt at the end of December 2000. 
				Arngren bought the bankruptcy estate back and started mail order sales again.
				The company's website has become known for its design. (Source:<a href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arngren_Electronics"> Wikipedia</a>)
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><span style="color:PaleGoldenRod">Contrast</span> : the color contrast is not good, in addition to the confusing layout of the website,
					some texts are difficult to read due to bad use of text and background color combination. 
					This can be fixed by using background and foreground colors that lie opposite of each other on a color wheel. <br></li>
				<li><span style="color:PaleGoldenRod">Repetition</span> : you won't see much repetition in this website. 
					Colors, fonts and shapes are not used consistently and there is no consistency in between different elements.
					This problem can be fixed by changing the overall design of the page. <br></li>
				<li><span style="color:PaleGoldenRod">Alignment</span> : elements do not line up and this has made a messy and confusing looking website.
					Elements don't have appropriate visual connections. This problem can be fixed by making specific/separate columns for pictures and text. <br></li>
				<li><span style="color:PaleGoldenRod">Proximity</span> : there is not enough proximity and organization. Finding a specific element or a related 
				group of elements in this website is very difficult due to the lack of appropriate design. 
				This problem should be solved by decreasing and then grouping/organizing the overwhelming amount of content on the page. <br></li>
