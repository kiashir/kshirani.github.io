        "text":"1. Avoid unattended or careless use of candles. No open flames are allowed inside any Tufts University building. <br><br> 2. Keep BBQ grills at least 10 feet from the house. Never store the grill with the propane tank inside your house. Propane vapors are heavier than air and any leak of the gas would travel down to an ignition source, such as a pilot light or electrical arc, that would initiate an explosion that would be fatal to anyone inside the house.<br><br> 3. Do not disable smoke or CO detectors. These are life saving devices that will give you an early warning to a life threatening event. Carbon monoxide, CO, is an odorless, colorless, and tasteless gas (known as the Silent Killer) that is the most abundant deadly byproduct of fire. Tampering, covering, disabling fire detection devices is a criminal offense, punishable by imprisonment and a fine and University disciplinary action.<br> <br> 4. Do not leave your cooking unattended. Cooking is the number one cause of residential fires. Unattended cooking increases the chance of a stove top fire. Watch what you heat and never overheat cooking oils. Should a flash fire occur in a pan, carefully slide a cover over the pan to smother the fire. DO NOT move it to the sink or apply water to it, this will cause the flaming oil to splash and spread the fire to surrounding areas. <br><br>"
