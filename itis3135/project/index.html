				<p>Fires can be classified into five different categories based of the agent that fuel them :</p>
				<div id="tabs">
					<h3>Class A: Ordinary Combustables</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							Class A fires are defined as ordinary combustibles. 
							These types are fires use commonly flammable material as their fuel source. 
							Wood, fabric, paper, trash, and plastics are common sources of Class A fires. 
							This is essentially the common accidental fire encountered across several different industries. 
							Trash fires are one such example. Class A fires are commonly put out with water or monoammonium phosphate.<br>

						</p>
					</div>
					<h3>Class B: Flammable Liquids</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							A Class B fire uses a flammable liquid or gas as its fuel base. 
							Common liquid based fuel sources include petroleum based oils and paints, kerosene, and gasoline. 
							Flammable gases such as butane or propane are also common fuel sources. 
							Class B fires are a common hazard in industries dealing with fuels, lubricants, and certain types of paint. 
							Smothering these types of fires to remove oxygen is a common solution as are chemical reactions that produce similar effects.<br>

						</p>
					</div>
					<h3>Class C: Electrical</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							The Class C fire is defined as a fire that uses electrical components and/or energized equipment as its fuel source. 
							Electrical fires are often fueled by motors, appliances, and electronic transformers. 
							Electrical fires are common in industries that deal with energy or make use of heavy electrically-powered equipment. 
							However, electrical fires can occur on smaller scales in all businesses (i.e. an overloaded surge protector or bad wiring) and should be taken seriously. 
							To extinguish such fires you cut the power off and use non-conductive chemicals to extinguish the fire.
						</p>
					</div>
					<h3>Class D: Combustible Metals</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							The Class D fire is defined as one that uses a combustible metal as its fuel source. 
							Examples of such combustible metals include titanium, magnesium, aluminum, and potassium. 
							Note that there are also other metals with combustive properties you may encounter. 
							Class D fires are a danger in laboratory environments. 
							However, be aware that combustible metals are used as part of production and other industry processes, and you need to be certain of what materials you are using for day-to-day operations. 
							When confronted with such a fire, common extinguishing agents such as water are ineffective and can be hazardous. 
							To extinguish a Class D fire, use a dry powder agent. 
							This absorbs the heat the fire requires to burn and smothers it as well. 
						</p>
					</div>
					<h3>Class F (EU/AU) / Class K (US): Cooking Oils and Fats</h3>
					<div>
						<p>
							A Class K fire is defined as a cooking fire involving combustion from liquids used in food preparation. 
							Technically a type of liquid fire, Class K fires are distinct enough to warrant their own classification. 
							Cooking fires are fueled by a wide range of liquid cooking materials. 
							Greases, cooking oils, vegetable fat, and animal fat are some common fuel sources. 
							Class K fires are naturally of concern in the food service and restaurant industry. 
							Such fires can be very dangerous and far more destructive than you may think. 
							Wet chemical fire extinguishers have become popular in putting out these types of fires.

				<p>It is very important to use proper fire extinguishing methods and safety procedures depending on the combustion type in order to control a fire.
					In this website you will learn more about different classes of fire and proper ways of extinguishing/controlling them.
				</p>
				<p>Four things must be present at the same time in order to produce fire:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Enough oxygen to sustain combustion</li>
					<li>Enough heat to raise the material to its ignition temperature</li>
					<li>Fuel or combustible material</li>
					<li>Chemical, exothermic reaction</li>
				</ul>
				<!--<p>Fires need three elements to keep burning:</p>-->

					<figcaption>Fire Triangle</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<hr>
				<p>Oxygen, heat, and fuel are frequently referred to as the "fire triangle." 
					Add in the fourth element, the chemical reaction, and you actually have a fire "tetrahedron." 
					The important thing to remember is: take any of these four things away, and you will not have a fire or the fire will be extinguished.
					Essentially, fire extinguishers put out fire by taking away one or more elements of the fire triangle/tetrahedron.
					Fire safety, at its most basic, is based upon the principle of keeping fuel sources and ignition sources separate.
